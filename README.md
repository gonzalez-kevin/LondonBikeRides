# LondonBikeRides
Data Analysis &amp; Tableau Dashboard of London Bike Rides dataset from Kaggle

**Here are the questions I was interested in asking:**
1. How do counts and averages of bike rides in London look based on user defined date filters?
2. Do wind speed and temperature have an effect on the count and average amount of bike rides?

**I took the following steps to complete my analysis:**
1. Analyzed data in Python to get a general understanding of the dataset
2. Used Python to redefine some unclear categorical variables
3. Created a report on moving average and count of bike rides based on used defined date filters
4. Created a heat map to see correlations between wind speed and temperature

**Here are my key takeaways:**
1. Generally there is a decline in average and total bike rides when temperature drops (Winter months)
2. Average and total count of bike rides in London follow a cyclical pattern
